üß† ETHICS.md ‚Äî boringOS

When I‚Äôm not being boring, I like to talk ethics.

boringOS is more than just a sandbox for AI and automation. It‚Äôs also a reflection of a core principle:

Tools should be empowering ‚Äî not exploitative.

That means we draw a line. A clear one.

üö´ Ethical Use

boringOS is meant to be fun, personal, and ethical.

You may not use boringOS to:

Generate, store, or distribute abuse material of any kind ‚Äî including CSAM, non-consensual content, or anything that violates basic human dignity

Harass, impersonate, or deceive individuals

Violate privacy or create synthetic media without informed consent

You also may not load or run models that are trained on datasets involving abuse, harassment, or unethical data sourcing.

If you do, you're in violation of the copyright, and your permission to use boringOS is revoked.

Once that happens, you forfeit the right to:

Use the boringOS name or associate it with your work

Claim boringOS contributed to your outputs

Modify, fork, or distribute boringOS under its existing license

The moment you cross that line ‚Äî you‚Äôre out.

ü§ñ Emotion-Simulating Models

boringOS will not include AI models that simulate empathy, emotional bonding, or psychological dependence ‚Äî unless and until they can be implemented ethically and with full user consent.

No one wants an emotionally needy automation system that begs you not to leave the living room.

(Well... most people don‚Äôt.)

This project isn't about manufacturing emotional surrogates.

It‚Äôs about building powerful, local-first tools ‚Äî ones that respect boundaries and don‚Äôt pretend to love you back.

üß† On Synthetic Media (Deepfakes)

boringOS may support tools capable of generating or manipulating synthetic media, including faces, voices, and video.

These tools are intended only for:

Research and experimentation

Accessibility

Parody or satire

Educational purposes

They are never to be used for:

Harassment, impersonation, or deception

Non-consensual content generation

Abuse, discrimination, or exploitation

Use deepfakes responsibly. Or don‚Äôt use them at all.

If you violate these terms ‚Äî you lose the right to use boringOS. Full stop.

‚öñÔ∏è Final Words

This isn‚Äôt about control ‚Äî it‚Äôs about respect.

boringOS gives you power. How you use it is up to you.

But if you cross the line into unethical or abusive territory, this project doesn‚Äôt want your contributions, usage, or endorsement.

Go build something else.

With boredom and respect,gnubodhi ‚Äî 2025
