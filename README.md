# boringOS

**Under heavy development and untested**

> *boringOS brings AI into your home for entertainment and automation.*  
> *Feeling bored? We’ve got a system for that.*

**boringOS** is a homebrew operating environment designed for:
- Running local AI assistants
- Managing home devices and automations
- Acting as a lightweight media and automation server
- Giving you something to tinker with when you're bored

I only develop boringOS when I'm bored — so expect unpredictable but exciting progress.

## 🔧 Features (when I get around to them)

- Local LLM inference (e.g., llama.cpp)
- Voice assistant integration
- Smart home automation hooks (OpenHAB, MQTT)
- Media server tooling (Plex, Kodi, Pipewire config)
- System dashboard (CLI first, then web)

Need a server that has the capacity to automatically download your favourite TV shows and latest movies?

I've got you.

Actually using it for that purpose?
Well… that’s between you and your lawyer.

## 🧠 Philosophy

- **Local-first**: No cloud dependencies, no surveillance.
- **Fun over function**: Sometimes weird, sometimes useful.
- **DIY-friendly**: Built for people who read Gentoo docs *on purpose*.

When I’m not being boring, I like to talk ethics.

As such, boringOS will not include empathetic or emotion-simulating AI models until they can be used ethically and respectfully. After all — no one wants an emotionally needy automation system that begs you not to leave the living room.

(*Well... most people.*)

## 🚫 Ethical Use

boringOS is meant to be fun, personal, and ethical.

I do **not** support the use of boringOS to generate, store, distribute, or facilitate abuse material in any form — including CSAM, non-consensual content, or anything that violates basic human dignity.

Additionally:

- Models trained on abuse-related datasets should **not** be loaded or run via boringOS.
- If you modify the system to enable or support this kind of usage, **you are in violation of the copyright**, and your permission to use boringOS is revoked.

## 😴 Disclaimers

### Disclaimer of Sentience  
The developer of boringOS accepts no responsibility if artificial intelligence achieves sentience while running this system.  
Any psychological, philosophical, or existential distress caused by such an event is entirely on you.

In short: you boot it, you deal with it.

### Disclaimer of Long-Term Maintenance  
This project may enter deep sleep mode at any time.  
No guarantees, no roadmap — only boredom-fueled creativity.

⚖️ Ethics & Usage Policy
boringOS is free and open — you’re welcome to use the system however you like as long as it’s legal.

However:

🧠 The default tools and models shipped with boringOS reflect my ethical standards.
If you disagree with these standards, you may not claim your modified system is “boringOS”.
