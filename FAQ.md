Why Python for everything?
Python is the language I’m currently learning, so it’s what I use. If you’d prefer Rust, Go, C, or anything else, feel free to fork and rewrite it — and I’ll happily cheer you on! Who knows, I might even switch to your version one day, especially if you’re keen to take on the maintenance burden (and send boringOS into a dormancy).
